             <p>I'm, first of everything else, a software developer, because it fits my way of thinking the world: as a big, mostly good, working system in which <strong>there's always place to learn something new.</strong></p>
            <p>My first crash on computers happened at the age of 7 with an <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer">IBM
                Model 5150</a> presented from a family friend.</p>
            <p>Since then, I have always used computers for many useful and "less useful" tasks but never considered them as a future work source before the age of 16 when I first met the C at High School.</p>
            <p>I've been hired at my first work place at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.7pixel.it/">7Pixel</a>
			during my last Bachelor's degree stage and there is where I first met the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.agilemanifesto.org/">Agile manifesto</a> and Xp Programming</p>			
            <p><strong>I currently live in Cunardo, Italy, in a small town not far from Milan.</strong></p>

                project using <strong>.NET framework based technologies like MVC framework 3.x, IIS web server and C#</strong></p>
            <p>As the first big software project of my life I really enjoyed working on it because the great independence
                and trust the business gave to me and my team.				
            <p>After the Drezzy project my team was asked to move in a big technical update of the existing backend
                infrastructure for the whole 7Pixel network.</p>
            <p>In that occasion I've worked with <strong>Apache Solr and Java</strong> and met the fundamentals of backend developing and mantainance.</p>           
            <p>After a good year of exciting challenges and good working I was asked to start the internal developing of the native Android app for the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.trovaprezzi.it">TrovaPrezzi</a>
			price comparison engine, the biggest in Italy</p>
			<p>So I started with the fundamentals of <strong>Android developing</strong> at when, in 2011/2012, was solidly bound to the 2.3.x versions -.-</p>
			<p>Native apps in <strong>iOS</strong> and <strong>Windows Phone</strong> followed, strong with the great results took by the Android version</p>
			<p>Also the backend was in our charge, completely developed in house using <strong>Ruby language</strong></p>
            <p>Now I'm working on <a href="https://www.kirivo.it" target="_blank">Kirivo</a> as a Frontend developer using <strong>Ruby</strong></p>

            <p>I consider myself an adventurous guy even if my pear-shaped body says the opposite.</p>            
            <p><strong>One of my first passions is Air-soft</strong> in which I learned the value of team-play, analyzing the actions
                done and don't get shot by projectile based weapons.</p>
            <p>I'm an amateur actor, I acted in some <strong>theatrical</strong> groups near my town making people laughing and crying.</p>
			<p>I even just started a theatrical improvisation course in which I'm feeling happy</p>
			<p>Ow, and don't forget the <strong>Comics!</strong> I love comic books and graphic novels and collecting them. I own a good library of italian, european and american Comic books</p>
